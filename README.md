### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Nottingham
- I work on shape optimisation of mechanical structures especially acoustic sound-absorbing materials.
- My current research interests are metaheuristics, topology optimisation and acoustics.
- Checkout my homepage at [VivekTRamamoorthy.github.io](https://VivekTRamamoorthy.github.io).

I enjoy the interactivity that web projects allow and hence, most of my recent projects have been web based. 

Here are some highlights if you are interested:

 - [MatlabJS: A Javascript mini library for Matlab users](https://www.github.com/VivekTRamamoorthy/MatlabJS)
      - A list of utility functions written in Javascript to help code conversion from Matlab 
    
 - [Possibly the simplest tutorial on Genetic algorithm](https://www.github.com/VivekTRamamoorthy/GeneticAlgorithmTutorial)
      - Learn what genetic algorithms are in 5 minutes interactively.
 - [Topology optimisation web app](https://www.github.com/VivekTRamamoorthy/TopOptWeb)
      - An interactive topology optimisation based on the SIMP algorithm.
 - [Damping ratio demo](https://www.github.com/VivekTRamamoorthy/SpringMassDamping)
      - An interactive demo for understanding the damping ratio in vibrating spring mass systems.
