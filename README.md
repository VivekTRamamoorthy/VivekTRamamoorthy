### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I am a recent PhD in Computer Science from the University of Nottingham's Computational Optimisation and Learning (COL) Lab.
- I work on shape and topology optimisation algorithms for lightweight acoustic sound-absorbing structures.
- My current research interests are metaheuristics, topology optimisation and acoustics.
- Check out my homepage at [VivekTRamamoorthy.github.io](https://VivekTRamamoorthy.github.io).

I enjoy the interactivity that web projects allow, and hence, most of my recent projects have been web-based. 

Here are some highlights:

 - [Topology optimisation web app](https://www.github.com/VivekTRamamoorthy/TopOptWeb)
      - An interactive topology optimisation based on the SIMP algorithm.
 - [MatlabJS: A Javascript library for Matlab/Octave users](https://www.github.com/VivekTRamamoorthy/MatlabJS)
      - A list of utility functions written in Javascript to help code conversion from Matlab/Octave
 - [Possibly the simplest tutorial on Genetic algorithm](https://www.github.com/VivekTRamamoorthy/GeneticAlgorithmTutorial)
      - Learn genetic algorithms in 5 minutes interactively.
 - [Damping ratio demo](https://www.github.com/VivekTRamamoorthy/SpringMassDamping)
      - An interactive demo to get an intuition for the damping ratio in mechanical vibration using spring-mass systems.
 - [Velloredle](https://vivektramamoorthy.github.io/Velloredle/)
      - A wordle-like app with memes created by a group of friends from Vellore.
