### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I am a recent PhD in Computer Science from the University of Nottingham.
- I work on shape optimisation of mechanical structures, predominantly acoustic sound-absorbing materials.
- My current research interests are metaheuristics, topology optimisation and acoustics.
- Check out my homepage at [VivekTRamamoorthy.github.io](https://VivekTRamamoorthy.github.io).

I enjoy the interactivity that web projects allow; hence, most of my recent projects have been web-based. 

Here are some highlights:

 - [MatlabJS: A Javascript mini library for Matlab users](https://www.github.com/VivekTRamamoorthy/MatlabJS)
      - A list of utility functions written in Javascript to help code conversion from Matlab 
    
 - [Possibly the simplest tutorial on Genetic algorithm](https://www.github.com/VivekTRamamoorthy/GeneticAlgorithmTutorial)
      - Learn what genetic algorithms are in 5 minutes interactively.
 - [Topology optimisation web app](https://www.github.com/VivekTRamamoorthy/TopOptWeb)
      - An interactive topology optimisation based on the SIMP algorithm.
 - [Damping ratio demo](https://www.github.com/VivekTRamamoorthy/SpringMassDamping)
      - An interactive demo for understanding the damping ratio in vibrating spring-mass systems.
