### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I am a Lecturer in the School of Physics, Engingeering and Computer Science at the University of Hertfordshire.
- My current interests are metaheuristics, structural topology optimisation and acoustics.
- Check out my homepage at [VivekTRamamoorthy.github.io](https://VivekTRamamoorthy.github.io).

I enjoy the interactivity that web projects allow, and hence, many of my recent projects are web-based. 

Here are some highlights:

 - [Topology optimisation web app](https://www.github.com/VivekTRamamoorthy/TopOptWeb)
      - An interactive topology optimisation based on the SIMP algorithm.
 - [MatlabJS: A Javascript library for Matlab/Octave users](https://www.github.com/VivekTRamamoorthy/MatlabJS)
      - A list of utility functions written in Javascript to help code conversion from Matlab/Octave
 - [Possibly the simplest tutorial on Genetic algorithm](https://www.github.com/VivekTRamamoorthy/GeneticAlgorithmTutorial)
      - Learn genetic algorithms in 5 minutes interactively.
 - [Damping ratio demo](https://www.github.com/VivekTRamamoorthy/SpringMassDamping)
      - An interactive demo to get an intuition for the damping ratio in mechanical vibration using spring-mass systems.
 - [Velloredle](https://vivektramamoorthy.github.io/Velloredle/)
      - A wordle-like app with memes created by a group of friends from Vellore.
